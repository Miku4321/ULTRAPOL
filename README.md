# ULTRAPOL
ULTRAPOL is an unofficial subset of another Github project called "ULL" (short for "Ultrakill Language Library") (alternatively "ULL").
Given you have both Bepinex and ULL installed, the files presented in this repository will allow you to play Ultrakill with polish text.

## Notes:
- I'll be occasionally making changes for the translation, this one isn't final.
- While we translated text to polish and provided a font with polish support, I didn't translate textures, nor voicelines. There are other polish teams that did dubbing, but I don't know if they finished their work.
- Ultrakill uses a VCR OSD MONO font, which doesn't have polish characters, and the official ULL release also does not. You'll have to replace the ullfont.resource file with the one I provided (that is, if I figure out how to upload it, lol).
- I'll soon add the ullfont.resource and the installation tutorial
